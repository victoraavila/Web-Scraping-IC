# Web-Scraping-IC
The code available on this repository is intended to download the most recent version of the Padr√£o TISS documentation, which describes how health insurance plans data may be transferred digitally.<br />

One of the advantages of this code is that it still works even with old versions of the **ANS** page. To check it out, try replacing the value of the **url** variable with [the link to this version from the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190717200124/http://www.ans.gov.br/prestadores/tiss-troca-de-informacao-de-saude-suplementar) (you will also need to comment out the banner closing loops).<br /> 
<br />
## Requirements
To properly run [**web-scraper.py**](https://github.com/victoraavila/Web-Scraping-IC/blob/main/web-scraper.py), you need to have the most recent version of **Mozilla Firefox** installed.<br />

You also need to have any version greater than **Python 3.6** installed.

The necessary Python modules can be successfully installed by typing the following in your bash terminal: <br />
<br />
```
$   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
<br />

Finally, if you are using **Windows**, you have to run the **geckodriver.exe** file located in 'Webdriver Proxy/Windows' to install it. This is necessary to execute Firefox autonomously. Linux users don't need to install geckodriver manually.<br />
<br />
## Running the program
After setting up all the requirements mentioned above, to run the Web Scraper you may access the root folder of this repository on a bash terminal and type the following command:<br />
<br />
```
$   python3 web-scraper.py
```
<br />

By default it runs in **Headless Mode**, i.e. without Firefox graphical interface. This can be changed by setting ***options.headless = False***:<br />
<br />
```python
    options = Options()
    options.headless = False
    driver = webdriver.Firefox(options = options)
```
<br />


After that, a .pdf file named **Componente Organizacional.pdf** with all the content will be downloaded and saved into the project root folder.
